### LONGEST PEAK

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in the array. A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which point they become strictly decreasing. At least three integers are required to form a peak.
For example, the integers 1, 4, 10, 2 form a peak, but the integers don't and neither do the integers 1, 2, 2, 0 . Similarly, the integers 1, 2, 3 don't form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the 3.
