### Water Area

You're given an array of non-negative integers where each non-zero integer represents the height of a pillar of width 1 . Imagine water being poured over all of the pillars; write a function that returns the surface area of the water trapped between the pillars viewed from the front. Note that spilled water should be ignored.
