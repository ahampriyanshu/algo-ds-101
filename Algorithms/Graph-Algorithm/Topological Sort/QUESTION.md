### Topological Sort 
You're given a list of arbitrary jobs that need to be completed; these jobs are represented by distinct integers. You're also given a list of dependencies. A dependency is represented as a pair of jobs where the first job is a prerequisite of the second one. In other words, the second job depends on the first one; it can only be completed once the first job is completed. 
Write a function that takes in a list of jobs and a list of dependencies and returns a list containing a valid order in which the given jobs can be completed. If no such order exists, the function should return an empty array.
