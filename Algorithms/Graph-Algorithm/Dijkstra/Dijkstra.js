/*EXPLANATION OF THE CODE =>We are using adjacency matrix.

Initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and
 the distances to all other nodes as infinite
Set all nodes to “unvisited”
While we haven’t visited all nodes:
1.Find the node with currently shortest distance from the source (for the first pass, this will be the source node itself)
2.For all nodes next to it that we haven’t visited yet, check if the currently smallest distance to that neighbor is bigger than if we were to go via the current node
If it is, update the smallest distance of that neighbor to be the distance from the source to the current node plus the distance from the current node to that neighbor
In the end, the array we used to keep track of the currently shortest distance from the source to all other nodes will contain the (final) shortest distances.
