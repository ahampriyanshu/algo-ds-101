## Selection Sort

In selection sort array is first divided into two part sorted and unsorted part. Then in unsorted part the minimum number is checked and shifted to first position similarly this process is carried till the array is sorted.

For example: [8 3 6 2] -> |[8 3 6 2] -> [2]|[8 3 6] -> [2 3]|[8 6] -> [2 3 6]|[8]     -> [2 3 6 8].
