## INSERTING SORT

Inserting sort is simple sorting process for example like we sort the cards. We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. In the same way, other unsorted cards are taken and put at their right place. A similar approach is used by insertion sort. Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
